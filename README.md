# VectorSimilarity

This repo exposes C API for using hnswlib implemetation for vector similarity search.
Allows Creating indices of vectors and searching for most K similar to some vector in two methods: brute force, and by using hnsw algorithm (probablistic).

The API headres is available in hnsw_c.h file.
